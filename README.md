**iGEM Hardware & Software Open-Source Project**
Welcome to the open-source hardware and software project by the CSMU-Taiwan team for the iGEM competition. Our aim is to provide a straightforward, reliable, and low-cost spectrophotometer solution that not only meets experimental requirements but also serves as an educational tool.

Project Structure and Content
**1. Espec - Professional Spectrophotometer Software**
EspecIonic:
An application developed with the Ionic framework, yet to be launched on the App Store or Google Play.

EspecWeb:
A version of Espec rewritten using HTML, its functionality is identical to the Ionic version.

Espec_User_Guide.pdf:
User guide for the Espec software.

**2. ver1_ResistanceMonitor_ArduinoR3 - Initial Hardware Design**
3D_Components:
3D design files for the first-generation hardware.

Arduino_Code:
Code for the Arduino Uno.

Assembly_Guide:
Assembly and usage guide for the hardware.

**3. ver2_LightMeasurement_ESP32 - Advanced Hardware Design**
3D_Components:
3D design files for the second-generation hardware.

Arduino_Code: Contains the code for the ESP32. This includes:
  - `ver2_LightMeasurement_ESP32.ino`: The initial version requiring Wi-Fi connectivity.
  - `ver2-2_LightMeasurement_ESP32_NoWIFI.ino`: An updated version that operates without the need for Wi-Fi connectivity, suitable for environments lacking network infrastructure.

Assembly_Guide:
Assembly and usage guide for the hardware.
